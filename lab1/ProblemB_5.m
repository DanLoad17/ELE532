%In both of the graphs, the beginning and peak of the positive slope have
%identical x and y coordinates, meaning the slope must also be identical.
%Both graphs also have the same ending y-value (the value of y that
%corresponds to the defined end of the time boundary), which is (2,0.75). 
% This is enough for us to conclude that both graphs are identical.
